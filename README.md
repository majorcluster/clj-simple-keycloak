# clj-simple-keycloak

![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.clojars.majorcluster/clj-simple-keycloak.svg) 

A Clojure library designed to authenticate 
and authorize basic permissions at an external keycloak server
Administration is so far not meant to be done here

## Usage

* Start keycloak:  
At `/docker-bakery-keycloak`
```shell
$ docker-compose up --force-recreate
```
* Add the dependency:
```clojure
[org.clojars.majorcluster/clj-simple-keycloak "LAST RELEASE NUMBER"]
```

* Configure your users, realms, clients and permissions at your `http://localhost:8090`:
  * [Keycloak docs](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html) 

* basic usage:
  * new-client-config [host realm client-id client-secret] => Builds a client map to be used on auth* methods 
  * authn!!  [kc-client-config username password] => Authenticates with username and password grant type, returning the tokens provided by keycloak. If it fails, it throws an ex-info
  * authz!!  [kc-client-config headers permission] => Authorizes user with a Authorization Bearer header (taken from `authn!!`), returning the tokens provided by keycloak. If it fails, it throws an ex-info

## Publish
### Requirements
* Leiningen (of course ðŸ˜„)
* GPG (mac => brew install gpg)
* Clojars account
* Enter clojars/tokens page in your account -> generate one and use for password
```shell
export GPG_TTY=$(tty) && lein deploy clojars
```
